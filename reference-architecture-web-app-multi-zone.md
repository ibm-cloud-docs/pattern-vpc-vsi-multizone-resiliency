# Web app multi-zone resiliency
{: #web-app-multi-zone}
{: toc-content-type="reference-architecture"}
{: toc-use-case="VirtualPrivateCloud"}
{: toc-version="1.0"}

The web app multi-zone resiliency architecture deploys a 3-tier web application on Virtual Servers for VPC by using compute, storage, and network cloud resources as well as other Cloud services provisioned across multiple availability zones within a single region.

## Architecture diagram
{: #architecture-diagram}

The Web, Application, and Database tiers are deployed on Virtual Servers for VPC (VPC VSIs) across two availability zones within the Workload VPC.
- The virtual servers in the web and app tiers are placed within [Placement Groups](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-placement-groups-for-vpc&interface=ui) for host failure protection and are part of [Instance Groups](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-auto-scale-instance-group&interface=ui) for autoscaling. A [VPC Application Load Balancer](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-load-balancers) is used to route traffic to healthy application servers.
- The database servers are deployed in active-standby mode. Data replication across availability zones is handled by the database software based on database specific high availability configuration options.
- IBM Storage Protect is used to create database backups to enable data recovery.

All data is encrypted by using customer-provided keys that are managed by [Key Protect](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-about).
- All storage is encrypted at rest with customer-provided keys.
- Data is encrypted in transit that uses TLS encryption. [Secrets Manager](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/secrets-manager){: external} is used to store and manage SSL/TLS certificates.
- The [Cloud Internet Services (CIS)](/docs/cis?topic=cis-getting-started) is deployed as a proxy to the public VPC Application Load Balancer that front ends the web tier to provide Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection and Web Application Firewall protection.

## Design scope
{: #design-scope}

The web app multi-zone resiliency architecture covers [design considerations](/docs/pattern-vpc-vsi-multizone-resiliency?topic=pattern-vpc-vsi-multizone-resiliency-compute-design) and [architecture decisions](/docs/pattern-vpc-vsi-multizone-resiliency?topic=pattern-vpc-vsi-multizone-resiliency-compute-design) for the following aspects and domains (as defined in the [Architecture Framework](/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro)):

- **Compute:** Virtual Servers
- **Storage:** Primary Storage, Backup Storage
- **Networking:** Enterprise Connectivity, Segmentation and Isolation, Cloud Native Connectivity, Load Balancing, Domain Name System
- **Security:** Data Security, Identity and Access Management, Application Security, Infrastructure and Endpoint Security
- **Resiliency:** High Availability, Backup and Restore,
- **Service Management:** Monitoring, Logging, Auditing, Alerting

The Architecture Framework provides a consistent approach to design cloud solutions by addressing requirements across a set of "aspects" and "domains", which are technology-agnostic architectural areas that need to be considered for any enterprise solution. See [Introduction to the Architecture Framework](/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro) for more details.

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The following represents a typical set of requirements for enterprise-ready web applications that are deployed in a public cloud.

| Aspects | Requirements |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Compute            | Provide properly isolated compute resources with adequate compute capacity for the applications. |
| Storage            | Provide storage that meets the application and database performance requirements. |
| Networking         | * Deploy workloads in an isolated environment and enforce information flow policies. \n * Provide secure, encrypted connectivity to the cloudâ€™s private network for management purposes. \n * Distribute incoming application requests across available compute resources. \n * Provide public and private DNS resolution. |
| Security           | * Ensure that all operator actions are run securely through a bastion host. \n * Protect the boundaries of the application against denial-of-service and application-layer attacks. \n * Encrypt all application data in transit and at rest to protect it from unauthorized disclosure. \n * Encrypt all backup data to protect it from unauthorized disclosure. \n * Encrypt all security data (operational and audit logs) to protect from unauthorized disclosure. \n * Encrypt all data by using customer-managed keys to meet regulatory compliance requirements for more security and customer control. \n * Protect secrets through their entire lifecycle and secure them using access control measures. |
| Resiliency         | * Support application availability targets and business continuity policies. \n * Provide highly available compute, storage, network, and other cloud services to handle application load and performance requirements. \n * Backup application data to enable recovery if unplanned outages occur. \n * Provide highly available storage for security data (logs) and backup data. |
| Service Management | * Monitor system and application health metrics and logs to detect issues that might impact the availability of the application. \n * Generate alerts/notifications about issues that might impact the availability of applications to trigger appropriate responses that minimize downtime. \n * Monitor audit logs to track changes and detect potential security problems. \n * Provide a mechanism to identify and send notifications about issues that are found in audit logs. |
