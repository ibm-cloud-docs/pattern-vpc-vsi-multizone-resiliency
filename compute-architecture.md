# Architecture decisions for compute
{: #compute-architecture}

The following are compute architecture decisions for the web app multi-zone resiliency pattern.

| Architecture decision | Requirement | Alternative | Decision | Rationale |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Compute Web, App, DB Tiers                                     | Provide properly isolated compute resources with adequate compute capacity for the applications | - Virtual Servers for VPC \n - Virtual Servers for VPC-Dedicated Hosts                                     | Virtual Servers for VPC                          | x86 compute within an isolated VPC network that can be quickly provisioned and scaled based on load requirements. \n \n Select the vCPU and memory configuration based on application requirements. |
| Virtual Servers for VPC: Profile for web tier                                           |                                                                                                   | - Balanced \n - Compute \n - Memory                                        |  Compute                  | The compute profile is recommended for the web tier, which tends to be higher in traffic workload and more CPU-intensive. |
| Virtual Servers for VPC: Profile for app tier                                           |                                                                                                   | - Balanced \n - Compute \n - Memory                                        | Memory                            | The memory profile is recommended for the app tier, which tends to be more memory-intensive and involves more caching. |
| Virtual Servers for VPC: Profile for database tier                                      |                                                                                                   | - Balanced \n - Compute \n - Memory                                        | Balance                           | The balance profile is recommended for databases. |
| Virtual Servers for VPC: Placement Group configuration   | Provide compute resources that are highly available and can handle increased workload demands   | - Host spread \n - Power spread                                         | Power spread                      | Power spread ensures that the virtual servers are placed on different computer hosts with different power and network supplies. |
| Virtual Servers for VPC: High availability configuration |                                                                                                   | - Multiple instances-single zone \n - Multiple instances-multiple zones | Multiple instances-multiple zones | Virtual servers are deployed across multiple availability zones to protect the application from zone outages. |
