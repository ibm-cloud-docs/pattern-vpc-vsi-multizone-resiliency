# Compute architecture decisions
{: #compute-architecture}

The following are computer architecture decisions for the web app multi-zone resiliency pattern.

| Architecture Decision | Requirement | Alternative | Decision | Rationale |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Compute Web, App, DB Tiers                                     | - Provide properly isolated compute resources with adequate compute capacity for the applications | - Virtual Servers for VPC \n - Virtual Servers for VPC-Dedicated Hosts                                     | Virtual Servers for VPC                          | x86 compute within isolated VPC network that can be quickly provisioned and scaled based on load requirements. Select the vCPU and memory configuration based on application requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Virtual Servers for VPC Profile for Web Tier                                           |                                                                                                   | - Balanced \n - Compute \n - Memory                                        |  Compute Profile                  | Select a Compute since this tier tends to be higher in traffic workload and workloads are more CPU-intensive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Virtual Servers Placement Group Configuration Web, App Tiers   | - Provide compute resources that are highly available and can handle increased workload demands   | - Host Spread \n - Power Spread                                         | Power Spread                      | Use virtual server placement groups for each tier to avoid single point of failures. Use “power spread” for the placement group to ensure the virtual servers are placed on different computer hosts with different power and network supplies. \n Use auto-scale instance groups along with placement groups to adjust the number of virtual servers in response to workload demands. |
| Virtual Servers High Availability Configuration Web, App Tiers |                                                                                                   | - Multiple instances-single zone \n - Multiple instances-multiple zones | Multiple instances-multiple zones | Deploy virtual servers in each placement group across multiple availability zones to protect the application from zone outages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
